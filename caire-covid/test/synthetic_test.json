{"version": "synthetic", "data": [{"title": "synthetic", "paragraphs": [{"context": "First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time since exposure. A fundamental shortcoming of screening is the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms, at which point they still feel healthy enough to undertake normal activities or travel. This difficulty is amplified when the incubation period is longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may mix socially or travel with low probability of detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For COVID-19, there is so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of travellers would be aware of a potential exposure. It is plausible that many individuals aware of a potential exposure would voluntarily avoid travel and practice social distancing--if so, the population of infected travellers will be skewed toward those unaware they have been exposed.", "qas": [{"question": "What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?", "id": 0, "answer": "limited evidence for specific risk factors"}, {"question": "What is the fundamental shortcoming of screening?", "id": 1, "answer": "the difficulty of detecting infected individuals during their incubation period, or early after the onset of symptoms"}, {"question": "Which kind of travellers are more likely to be infected?", "id": 2, "answer": "those unaware they have been exposed"}, {"question": "Symptom screening depends on what?", "id": 3, "answer": "the natural history of an infection and whether exposure risk factors exist"}, {"question": "What will happen with increasing time since exposure?", "id": 4, "answer": "individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms"}]}]}, {"title": "synthetic", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
