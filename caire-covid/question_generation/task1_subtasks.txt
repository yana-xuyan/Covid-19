What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?

What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? What do we know about natural history, transmission, and diagnostics for the virus? What have we learned about infection prevention and control?

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.
Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).
Seasonality of transmission.
Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).
Persistence and stability on a multitude of substrates and sources (e.g., nasal discharge, sputum, urine, fecal matter, blood).
Persistence of virus on surfaces of different materials (e,g., copper, stainless steel, plastic).
Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person
Implementation of diagnostics and products to improve clinical processes
Disease models, including animal models for infection, disease and transmission
Tools and studies to monitor phenotypic change and potential adaptation of the virus
Immune response and immunity
Effectiveness of movement control strategies to prevent secondary transmission in health care and community settings
Effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and its usefulness to reduce risk of transmission in health care and community settings
Role of the environment in transmission
