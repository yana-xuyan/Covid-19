important to obtain reliable estimates of the overall case fatality ratio (CFR), i.e., the proportion of all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected cases that will die as a result of the disease.", "171": "[7] Some cases are characterized by mild symptoms and close-to-normal body temperatures and some are asymptomatic carriers, but both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are contagious, which leads to difficulties in the timely identification of cases.", "172": "Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board (and before the disembarkation of a large number of passengers), the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited Among disembarked passengers, symptomatic cases have started to be reported on the ground in and outside of Japan.", "173": "There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China.", "174": "Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020).", "175": "The symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR) defines a case as someone who is infected and shows certain symptoms.", "176": "Their findings show that COVID-19 was mild for 81% of patients and had an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%.", "177": "In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, illness may evolve over the course of a week or longer, beginning with mild symptoms that progress (in some cases) to the point of dyspnea and shock [11] .", "178": "More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.", "179": "Mean incubation period 5.5 days Sensitivity: 4.5 or 6.5 Clinical data: 83% fever, 67% cough, n = 6 (Chan et al., 2020) 83% fever, 82% cough, n = 99 98% fever, 76% cough, n = 41 43.8% fever at hospital admission, 88.7% fever during hospitalization, n = 1099 Active monitoring after repatriation flights or on cruise ships: % asymptomatic at diagnosis 31.2% (111/355) (Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 2020) 65.2% (5 of 8) (Nishiura et al., 2020) 70.0% (7 of 10)", "180": "Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.", "181": "Subjectively, COVID-19 involves mild infections among the general population, but the risk of death among young adults is higher than for seasonal influenza, and the mortality among older adults with comorbidities requires close attention.", "182": "Moreover, considering that about 9% of all infected individuals are ascertained and reported [24] , the infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e., the risk of death among all infected individuals, would be on the order of 0.5% to 0.8%.", "183": "To understand the severity of infection, i.e., the virulence of the causative agent of COVID-19, the common epidemiological practice is to estimate the case fatality risk (CFR) as the risk of death among cases (for the sake of practical interpretation, we refer to it as the case fatality risk rather than the case fatality rate [2] ).", "184": "Owing to the infectivity of 2019-nCoV, ECMO poses a high risk when it is performed for COVID-19 patients, which might produce various body fluid splashes, including airway secretions, blood, and others.", "185": "In addition to the fragility of medical institutions in the face of the new coronavirus epidemic, the risk of infection complications among hospital populations is also greatly increased [10] [11] .", "186": "From the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period we found that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days, and we stress that the 17-24-day time delay from illness onset to death must be addressed when estimating COVID-19 case fatality risk.", "187": "The high risk factors of cardiac injury including tachycardia, TnI elevation and low EAT density in CT scan, have been observed in the severe and critical COVID-19 patients.", "188": "Using (5) with application to MERS, the risk of death among patients older than 60 years of age was estimated to be 9.3 times greater than those in the younger age group [16] .", "189": "Communicating the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)", "190": "Meanwhile, numbers of patients with COVID-19 infection had chronic comorbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is similar to MERS-COV population.", "191": "An immunological explanation of the opposite phenomenon, with a lower susceptibility of younger individuals, seems unlikely, and there is no indication of pre-existing immunity to COVID-19 in humans [10] .", "192": "Those results indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be more susceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.", "193": "1, 2 We believe that the susceptibility to the novel 2019-nCov is also different among population groups.", "194": "Although the relationship between smoking history and susceptibility as well as worse outcomes in COVID-19 remains unclear, we cautioned that the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with smoking history might be more severe.", "195": "The possible reason of reduced susceptibility of females to viral infection is that females have a lot of X chromosome and estrogen that are vital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity [47] .", "196": "Our estimation process consists of calculating an age-specific susceptibility profile based on epidemiological data from China and the estimated China-level contact matrix [3] .", "197": "Table 2 Table 3 shows the perceived susceptibility and perceived severity towards COVID-19 among 189 respondents.", "198": "While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.", "199": "Since COVID-19 is a new disease and prior knowledge is lacking, we employed a phenome-wide approach in which a large variety of traits are studied for causal associations with ACE2 expression.", "200": "The simulation results under scenarios (1)-(3) indicate that the public health control measures could effectively mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak on the ship in terms of the final size, see Table 1 .", "201": "In the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19, all these aspects have not yet been fully addressed, although the global public health community is obliged to continually confront the epidemic and make political decisions encompassing travel restrictions, containment measures, and mitigation strategies.", "202": "Thus, control measures as well as self-administered protective actions are crucial to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus mitigate the outbreak size and prevent for further burden.", "203": "Intensive control measures, including travel restrictions, have been implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19 in China.", "204": "Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an online tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19.", "205": "The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of varied interventions and selfprotection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province by establishing a COVID-19 transmission model incorporating the intervention measures implemented and fitting the data obtained from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC).", "206": "Meanwhile, public health specialists implemented control measures and mitigation procedures to prevent the spread of the disease [13] .", "207": "Given that effective COVID-19-specific pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines are not expected to be available for months, NPIs are essential components of the public health response to the ongoing outbreaks.", "208": "Also, because multiple unlinked community cases of COVID-19 have been reported (21) , various social distancing measures have been put in place including advising the public against large social gatherings in order to mitigate the risk of community transmission (22, 23) .", "209": "The most effective prevention and control measures are to find suspected patients and close contacts, confirm patients and virus carriers, and block the transmission through isolation, disinfection, and personal protection."}
