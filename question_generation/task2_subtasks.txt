What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?
What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors? What have we learned from epidemiological studies?

Specifically, we want to know what the literature reports about:

Data on potential risks factors
Smoking, pre-existing pulmonary disease
Co-infections (determine whether co-existing respiratory/viral infections make the virus more transmissible or virulent) and other co-morbidities
Neonates and pregnant women
Socio-economic and behavioral factors to understand the economic impact of the virus and whether there were differences.
Transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors
Severity of disease, including risk of fatality among symptomatic hospitalized patients, and high-risk patient groups
Susceptibility of populations
Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control
